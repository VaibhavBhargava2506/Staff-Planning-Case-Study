# Optimisation Case Study - Staff Planning

Problem Introduction
The insurance approval process, i.e., underwriting is one of the important and time-consuming tasks in an insurance application processing. When you submit your insurance application, the underwriter of the company evaluates it based on the details that you provide using a rule-based or an ML model and decides whether or not to approve your application. 
An insurance company InsurePlus wants you to help them with finding the optimal number of staff that they need for their insurance application approval process for the calendar year 2021.  In the industry, the number of staffs is considered as a continuous variable. This is also called a staff Full-Time Equivalent. For example, if a full-time employee (FTE =1) works for 50 hours a week, 10 hours corresponds to 0.2 FTEs. If the pay for 50 hours a week is $5000, then 0.2 FTE who may be a part-time employee will be paid $1000 (5000*0.2). 
* The company operates in three states A, B, and C.
* The company can either handle an application with the staff that they hire or outsource it to a vendor. (Assume that there is no capacity limitation to outsourcing.) 
* If they hire staff, he/she can handle 40 insurance applications per month when he/she works 100% of the workdays. However, there are days that he/she will be unavailable to process applications due to training, off days, etc. 
* A staff memberâ€™s availability (in percentage) to work on processing the insurance applications for each month is shown in the table given below. As mentioned before, with 100% availability, each member can handle 40 applications.
             
A special note of practical relevance: In the industry, staff availability is predicted using a time-motion study. But in this case, you have been given fixed numbers for each month. 
States A and B have a regulatory restriction that the outsourced insurance applications cannot be more than 30% and 40% of the total number of applications for each month, respectively. 
The objective is to optimise the total cost for the application approval process by distributing the right number of applications between the FTEs and the vendors while meeting the monthly demand for each state at the same time.
